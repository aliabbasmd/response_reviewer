# Response to Reviewers: LLM Informatics Research Pipeline

This repository hosts the complete, 39-step computational pipeline designed for the Frontiers manuscript. It is structured to provide full transparency and reproducibility for the journal's peer-review process.

## ⚠️ Important: Sequential Execution
To fully replicate the study's findings, **the scripts must be executed in numerical order (Step 1 through Step 39).** * Each script generates specific data structures, metadata, or statistical variables that are required by the subsequent step.
* Skipping steps or running them out of order will result in file-path errors or missing variable dependencies.

## 📂 Samples Directory (Worked-Out Results)
For reviewers who wish to inspect the final outputs without running the entire 39-step pipeline, the **`samples/`** directory contains:
* **Partially Completed Notebooks:** Documented snapshots of the analysis at key milestones.
* **Worked-Out Results:** Final HTML reports and Jupyter Notebooks containing the completed visualizations, statistical tables, and model performance metrics as they appear in the manuscript.
* **High-Resolution Figures:** The raw visual outputs generated by the pipeline.

## 🧬 Pipeline Phase Overview
1. **Foundation (Steps 1-9):** Data generation, verification, and distribution analysis.
2. **LLM Integration (Steps 10-20):** Embedding extraction (BERT/Llama), comparative visualization, and complexity mapping.
3. **Classification Logic (Steps 21-27):** Cluster performance, diagnostic cutoffs, and AUC significance testing.
4. **Regression & Drivers (Steps 28-39):** Comparative regression analysis, MAE diagnostics, and identifying structural drivers of LLM performance.

## 🛠 Setup & Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:aliabbasmd/response_reviewer.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Begin replication: `python step1_generate_data.py`
